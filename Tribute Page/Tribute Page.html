     <p>
       <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> <em>(1452-1519)</em> was born in Anchiano, Tuscany (now Italy), close to the town of Vinci that provided the surname we associate with him today. In his own time he was known just as Leonardo or as “Il Florentine,” since he lived near Florence—and was famed as an artist, inventor and thinker.
     </p>
     <p>He is the genius who epitomized the renaissance humanist ideal. His approach to science was observational. He tried to understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasize experiments or theoretical explanations. Leonardo studied mathematics under ‘Luca Pacioli’ and prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates for Pacioli’s book ‘Divina Proportione’.</p>

The 60 candles were then distributed among the four churches.</p>
